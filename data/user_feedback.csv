1,Engineer,5,4,Dashboard is intuitive and loads quickly.
2,Investor,1,2,Filter system is completely unusable; can't isolate projects by ROI.
3,Engineer,2,3,Data is clear but lacks granularity. Where is the raw API feed?
4,Policy,1,1,The map visualization is misleading and omits key underserved communities.
5,Investor,2,2,Charging cost calculator is simplistic and doesn't factor in peak demand pricing. Useless for forecasting.
6,Engineer,1,4,The cost calculator uses outdated efficiency metrics. Results are unreliable.
7,Investor,5,5,Filters are perfect for my needs - exactly what I was looking for.
8,Policy,4,5,Map overlay for policy zones is excellent and very clear.
9,Engineer,3,2,More maps would be good, but the projection is wrong and distances are inaccurate.
10,Policy,5,5,Extremely clear presentation of complex data. Well done.
11,Policy,2,4,The cost calculator doesn't model the impact of new subsidies. This is a critical gap.
12,Policy,1,3,Calculator is not just bad, it's actively misleading for policy decisions.
13,Investor,2,1,Policy insights are surface-level. I need deep-dive reports on regulatory risk, which are absent.
14,Policy,5,5,The ability to add custom map layers is a game-changer for our planning.
15,Engineer,1,2,Calculator's algorithm is a black box. No way to verify inputs/outputs. Cannot trust it.
16,Investor,1,1,Dashboard is a cluttered mess. I can't find the key financial KPIs.
17,Investor,4,3,The maps are great, but why can't I export the site locations to a spreadsheet?
18,Engineer,2,1,Filters are too rigid. I need to filter by a custom SQL query, not these pre-set options.
19,Investor,3,4,Simpler filters helped, but now I can't drill down into capex details. It's a trade-off.
20,Engineer,4,2,Policy insights are good but too high-level. Need to see the underlying technical assumptions.
21,Policy,5,4,Adding census tract data to the maps was the right move. Huge improvement.
22,Investor,1,3,Make filters simpler? I'd settle for them just working. They constantly timeout.
23,Engineer,5,2,The complex filters are the best part, but the UI for them is confusing.
24,Engineer,4,1,I can make the filters work, but it's not intuitive at all. Terrible UX but powerful.
25,Investor,1,2,The cost calculator doesn't include maintenance costs. This completely invalidates the ROI projection.
26,Investor,3,1,Maps are visually appealing but lack crucial data layers like traffic flow.
27,Investor,2,5,The interface is clear, but the functionality is basic and doesn't support my workflow.
28,Investor,1,2,Policy insights are not just lacking, they are outdated by 6 months. This is a liability.
29,Engineer,5,1,Maps are technically impressive and fast, but the legend is cryptic and unclear.
30,Policy,3,3,The calculator is okay for rough estimates, but it's not robust enough for official reporting.
